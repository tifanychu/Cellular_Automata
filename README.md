## Introduction

Created a general-purpose Cellular Automata (CA) Library 

Implemented a two-dimensional CA Application that mimics the spread of pests in crops. 

Purpose of our application is to allow farmers to find the optimal density in which to plant crops to minimize the risk of pest spread.

List of files in this directory: 
- FinalProject_Assessment.pdf: Brief Summary of the CA Application, CA Modeling and Simulation. We decided to simulate the effects of plant density on pest spread using the cellular automata general purpose library we created. The pdf here contains a brief summary of what we implemented, the conditions used and the results from our project. The images and data shown in this pdf is found in the /plots subdirectory. (both the python notebook used to generate these graphs and the images themselves.)

- Individual_Reflection.pdf: My own reflection on the project.
